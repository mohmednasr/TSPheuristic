# TSPheuristic
Implemented heuristics algorithms to solve Travel Sales Problem 

This file contains the implementation of three algorithms 
(Nearest Neighbour Heuristic, Extend Nearest Neighbour Heuristic,
 and Greedy Heuristic)  to solve the Traveling Sales Problem.

The implementation of Nearest Neighbour Heuristic on the file "NNH.cpp"
The implementation of Extend Nearest Neighbour Heuristic on the file "ENNH.cpp"
The implementation of Greedy Heuristic on the file "GreedyH.cpp"

I implemented these algorithms from scratch.

The input is a file "example_instance.txt"
	contain in first line the dimension of the matrix "the number of cities"
	after that contain the matrix and on the digonal contain "-" instead of 0.

The output is the path of the shortest path.
